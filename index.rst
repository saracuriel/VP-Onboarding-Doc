EJP RD Virtual Platform: Resources onboarding manual
===================================


Disclaimer
--------

This version of the document is intended for the connection to the Virtual Platform at Level 1 (resource discovery) and Level 2 (content-based discovery).

The Level 3 connections described in this version will be further developed based on the work of the Distributed Analysis focus group.

Purpose of this document
--------

The purpose of this document is to guide resources to connect to the EJP RD Virtual Platform (EJP RD VP) network according to the reference implementation. This version of the document primarily focuses on the requirements for enabling publishing of metadata, referred to as Level 1 and discoverability of resources by safe federated querying, known as Level 2. Detailed information about Level 3 (remote interrogation and analysis of sensitive data) will be incorporated in future updates of this document. The Onboarding document is intended for those who are tasked to make data reusable for rare disease research. Getting a resource on board the EJP RD VP is a means to that end.
