Guidelines to test the Level 2 connection through the VP portal
~~~~~


The VP portal uses the Level 2 connection of resources for monitoring and discovery. The following steps should be performed to enable and test a successful connection to the VP portal.
* **Monitoring**
	All resources within the VP Network are visualized in the VP Portal. Resources connected at Level 2 receive simple queries on a scheduled basis to indicate the current status of the connection. Check if your resource is listed at [`link <https://vp.ejprarediseases.org/discovery/sources>`_], and the connection icon appears in green. 

* **Discovery**
	To test the functionality of the discovery, you should undertake some test queries in the VP-Portal interface [`link <https://vp.ejprarediseases.org/discovery>`_]. To check the validity of the result, you should perform the same search query in your local database and via the VP Portal to verify the results. In case of discrepancies, the result of the ERDERA Beacon v2 API should be checked directly to exclude an implementation error. If different results continue to appear, report your problem by sending an email to `vp.onboarding@ejprd-project.eu <mailto:vp.onboarding@ejprd-project.eu>`_.
