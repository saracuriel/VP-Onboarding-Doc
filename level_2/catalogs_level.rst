Content-Based Discovery at /catalogs Level
------------

At the /catalog level, answers are derived from summary metadata about the entities listed within a resource (typically a catalog or a resource that contains multiple sub-resources). The following table shows an overview of the filters used at the /catalog level, as defined in the ERDERA VP API Specification [`link <https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs>`_]. 

The filters shown in the table below can be applied to a query to only show certain results.
