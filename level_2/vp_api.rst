How to onboard to Level 2 using the VP-API Specification

Transitioning to Level 2 involves seamlessly integrating resources with the EJP RD VP API Specification, a gateway to further unlock the capabilities of the Virtual Platform. This integration is facilitated by a suite of optional tools that pave the way for a comprehensive resource discovery experience. We offer five solutions for onboarding, which are described in the following sections. Figure 7 depicts the steps of the Level 2 onboarding process.
