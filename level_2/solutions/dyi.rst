EJP RD Beacon v2 DIY approach for Level 2 onboarding
------------

Two elements are needed to implement (or "light") an EJP RD Beacon v2: 
* An internal **database** (where the resource data is stored).
* An EJP RD **Beacon v2 API** that provides a standardized way to send queries and receive responses (containing yes/no, counts or data).

------------

* The EJP RD Beacon v2 API Specification to be followed, to be compliant with the VP Platform ecosystem: `lind <https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs>`_
* About GA4GH Beacon: `lind <https://docs.genomebeacons.org/>`_.
* CRG developed B2RI set of tools for when you want to "beaconize" your data to be part of the ecosystem, but you're unsure where to start, and/or don't want to invest a lot of resources because you are still unsure if the whole thing will pay off: `lind <https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beacon-v2-reference-implementation/>`_. This solution requires the use of Docker, as opposed to the BiaB approach (non-docker) described above.
