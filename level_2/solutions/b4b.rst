against the FHIR Store of the Bridgehead, and returns the count of individuals or biosamples. 
Since the API relies on the Sample Locator's Bridgehead, a biobank that has already joined it can be onboarded in the EJP-RD VP by adding the
Beacon4Biobank service to its stack. If a biobank is not in the BBMRI Sample Locator, it can first
