Requirements to achieve Level 1: Resource Discovery
===================================

Level 1 connection is the initial and the only required step for a resource to contribute to the EJP RD VP and serves as a foundation for higher connection levels. When a resource onboards at Level 1, it provides basic information about itself in a standardised, machine-interpretable way (i.e., ‘metadata for machines’). 

The EJP RD VP utilizes a metadata model based on the ‘`Data Catalogue Vocabulary <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/>`_’ (DCAT) for describing this minimal information for computers. DCAT is a widely used vocabulary, recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The metadata model is hereafter referred to as the EJP RD VP metadata schema.

In this section, the EJP RD VP metadata schema is described along with the metadata items (properties) that describe the different types of resources. Understanding this metadata schema is essential for onboarding at Level 1 on the EJP RD VP Network. Following the description of the metadata schema, we present an `outline of the different technical options <>`_ to connect to the EJP RD VP Portal. All the options provided depend on the understanding of the EJP RD VP metadata schema and where your resource fits within it. The required metadata items and their implementations for connecting to the EJP RD VP at Level 1 are described in the next section of this document.
